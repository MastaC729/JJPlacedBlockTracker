## Reporting Issues
If you find a bug with this plugin, please format your issue as such:

+ Version of JJPlacedBlockTracker:
+ Version of Sponge: 
+ Version of Forge (if necessary):
+ Stacktrace (IN A PASTEBIN OR SIMILAR FORMAT):
+ Steps to recreate the issue:

DO NOT send us stacktraces within the post if they are huge, and do not post your entire log file. It looks sloppy, and all we usually need to see is the specific stacktrace relevant to the crash or issue, if a stacktrace occurred.
